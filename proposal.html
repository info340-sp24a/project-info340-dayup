           <h2>Problem Description</h2>
           <p>
               College life can be stressful – academic pressure, peer pressure, financial burden,
               and concerns towards future careers. According to the National Education Association,
               “The majority of college students today meet the criteria for at least one mental
               health problem”, and “44% of students reported symptoms of depression,
               37% reported anxiety disorders, 15% reported having seriously considered
               suicide in the past year” according to University of Michigan’s annual
               Healthy Minds Study report. Student mental health is in crisis.
               The ability to cope with stress and to be aware of and manage one’s emotions
               have become the key to improving college students’ mental health. To destress,
               an effective way is to seek emotional support animals but many students
               face constraints in keeping one. Therefore, our solution is to offer a digital
               emotional support puppy. It checks in with you daily, tracks your mood,
               provides comfort, and supports you as a digital companion.

               There may not be direct parallels to this exact concept,
               but various mood-tracking apps and platforms exist. Examples include
               mood diary apps (Daylio, MoodPress) and mental health awareness apps
               (Mindness, Moodfit). These applications often employ algorithms or user-input data
               to track mood changes over time, offer meditation/awareness sessions, and provide
               insights or recommendations. However, matching moods with puppy breeds for daily
               emotional support seems like a unique idea that might have been unexplored before.
               One information technology problem in this space could be the effectiveness and
               accuracy of matching individuals' moods with specific dog breeds. While the concept
               is intriguing, there may be challenges in ensuring that the mechanism used for
               matching accurately reflects the user's mood and personality traits.
