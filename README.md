**Problem/Data Domain**

College life can be stressful – academic pressure, peer pressure, financial burden, and concerns towards future
careers. According to the National Education Association, “The majority of college students today meet the criteria for at least one mental health problem”, and “44% of students reported symptoms of depression, 37% reported anxiety disorders, 15% reported having seriously considered suicide in the past year” according to University of Michigan’s annual Healthy Minds Study report. Student mental health is in crisis. The ability to cope with stress and to be aware of and manage one’s emotions have become the key to improving college students’ mental health. To destress, an effective way is to seek emotional support animals but many college students face constraints in keeping one. Our solution is to offer a digital emotional support puppy. It checks in with you daily, tracks your mood, provides comfort, and supports you as a digital companion.

There may not be direct parallels to this exact concept, but various mood-tracking apps and platforms exist
Examples include mood diary apps (Daylio, MoodPress) and mental health awareness apps (Mindness, Moodfit). These applications often employ algorithms or user-input data to track mood changes over time, offer meditation/awareness sessions, and provide insights or recommendations. However, matching moods with puppy breeds for daily emotional support seems like a unique idea that might have been unexplored before. One information technology problem in this space could be the effectiveness and accuracy of matching individuals' moods with specific dog breeds. While the concept is intriguing, there may be challenges in ensuring that the mechanism used for matching accurately reflects the user's mood and personality traits.

**App Description**

For our project, while we are focusing on different types of dogs, we found many useful external sites. First is a GitHub CSV file, a List of dog breeds recognized by the FCI, at https://github.com/paiv/fci-breeds.git. Besides, we also have an MBTI-type dog image in our project. For characters of dogs and chatting with them, we are considering using Open AI or assumed scenarios to create interactions.


This repository contains code for an interactive information web app, created for the _Client-Side Web Development_ course at the UW iSchool.
