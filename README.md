**Problem/Data Domain**

College life can be stressful – academic pressure, peer pressure, financial burden, and concerns towards future
careers. According to the National Education Association, “The majority of college students today meet the criteria for at least one mental health problem”, and “44% of students reported symptoms of depression, 37% reported anxiety disorders, 15% reported having seriously considered suicide in the past year” according to University of Michigan’s annual Healthy Minds Study report. Student mental health is in crisis. The ability to cope with stress and to be aware of and manage one’s emotions have become the key to improving college students’ mental health. To destress, an effective way is to seek emotional support animals but many college students face constraints in keeping one. Our solution is to offer a digital emotional support puppy. It checks in with you daily, tracks your mood, provides comfort, and supports you as a digital companion.

There may not be direct parallels to this exact concept, but various mood-tracking apps and platforms exist
Examples include mood diary apps (Daylio, MoodPress) and mental health awareness apps (Mindness, Moodfit). These applications often employ algorithms or user-input data to track mood changes over time, offer meditation/awareness sessions, and provide insights or recommendations. However, matching moods with puppy breeds for daily emotional support seems like a unique idea that might have been unexplored before. One information technology problem in this space could be the effectiveness and accuracy of matching individuals' moods with specific dog breeds. While the concept is intriguing, there may be challenges in ensuring that the mechanism used for matching accurately reflects the user's mood and personality traits.

**App Description**
*Users of the Application:*
The users of our application can be people who need emotional support or love dogs. Our application would provide a emotional dog for users everyday based on user’s mood. The dog can company users. It can provide emotional support to the minority groups. Our web app includes a short quiz for users, which is about their mood. Based on the result of the test, the web app will provide an emotional dog for users. Users also can interact with the emotional dogs. For example, users can chat with the emotional dog. The emotional dog would company users for one day. Users can do the quiz everyday. Based on different mood they has on each day, users can collect different types of emotional dog. Our web app will provide an emotion report for users every week based on what types of dog they have collect in this week.

*External sources:*
For our project, while we are focusing on different types of dogs, we found many useful external sites. First is a GitHub CSV file, a List of dog breeds recognized by the FCI, at https://github.com/paiv/fci-breeds.git. Besides, we also have an MBTI-type dog image in our project. For characters of dogs and chatting with them, we are considering using Open AI or assumed scenarios to create interactions.

*Usage and impact of the system:*
MoodBuddy is designed to be a helpful and easily accessible application for managing stress levels and relieving pressure. After completing a brief mood quiz, the application will pair the user with a puppy that provide optimal mood support. The digital puppy will provide emotional assistance by accompanying users until their mood improves. During interacting with a puppy, users can cultivate feelings of responsibility, empathy, and happiness. Additionally, interacting with a digital friend can help to reduce anxiety and stress. Through using the app, users can also track their mood changes by reviewing the weekly/monthly mood report, enabling them to effectivly manage their emotions.
