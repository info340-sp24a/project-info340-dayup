hi jennifer


For our project, while we are focusing on different types of dogs, we found many useful external sites. First is a GitHub CSV file, a List of dog breeds recognized by the FCI, at https://github.com/paiv/fci-breeds.git. Besides, we also have an MBTI-type dog image in our project. For characters of dogs and chatting with them, we are considering using Open AI or assumed scenarios to create interactions.


This repository contains code for an interactive information web app, created for the _Client-Side Web Development_ course at the UW iSchool.
